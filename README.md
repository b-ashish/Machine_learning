        <h1>Machine Learning Project: Used Car Price Prediction</h1>
    
        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                The Used Car Price Prediction project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the selling price
                of used cars. This project is particularly valuable for both buyers and sellers in the pre-owned car market,
                providing insights into fair pricing based on various features.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the increasing demand for used cars, accurately predicting their prices becomes crucial for sellers to
                set competitive prices and for buyers to make informed decisions. This machine learning model takes into
                account factors such as the car's make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, and other relevant
                features to provide an estimate of the car's market value.

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Data Collection:</h3>
                <p>
                    Gather a comprehensive dataset comprising information about various used cars. Key features include make, model,
                    year of manufacture, mileage, fuel type, transmission type, number of owners, and any additional relevant details.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Data Preprocessing:</h3>
                <p>
                    Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring consistency in data types. This step
                    may involve encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and transforming data for better model compatibility.
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</h3>
                <p>
                    Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution of features, identify patterns, and
                    visualize relationships between different variables. EDA helps in understanding the data's characteristics and informs
                    feature selection.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Feature Engineering:</h3>
                <p>
                        Create new features or modify existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model. For example, derive features such as the age of the car or calculate the average mileage per year.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <h3>Model Selection:</h3>

                        Choose a suitable machine learning model for regression, as predicting car prices involves continuous numeric values. Common models include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting algorithms.
                    
                    </li>

            <li>
                <h3>
                    Training the Model:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance. Train the selected model on the training set, adjusting parameters as needed. The goal is to create a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data.
                </p>
            </li>
                   

            <li>
                <h3>
                    Model Evaluation:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). This step helps assess how well the model predicts used car prices.
                </p>
            </li>

                    Prediction:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Use the trained model to predict the prices of new, unseen used cars based on their features. This functionality provides users with estimated prices, aiding in decision-making for both buyers and sellers.
                </p>
            </li>

                <h3>
                    User Interface
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Implement a user interface for users to input car details and receive price predictions. This can be a web application, mobile app, or a simple command-line interface, depending on the project's scope.
